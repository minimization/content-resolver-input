  packages:
    # Each ICU major version is incompatible with the previous.  When icu 
    # is bumped, a libicuNN compat package is created, but dependent packages
    # are not immediately rebuilt.  The new icu build gets triggered in ELN,
    # but CR doesn't know to trigger a build of the compat package, and
    # everything breaks as a result.
    #
    # Generally, this resolves to libicu already listed in the icu 
    # workload, but this should assure that the next compat package gets 
    # rebuilt immediately. Once the compat has been rebuilt for ELN and is 
    # listed by CR, this should then be updated to the new major version in 
    # libicu.  At that point, CR will continue to handle the compat package 
    # normally until all dependents have been updated for the new libicu 
    # version, at which point the compat package will drop out of ELN.
