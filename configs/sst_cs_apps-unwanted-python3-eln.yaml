  - python3-pytz
  # python3-chardet was pulled into RHEL 9 as a dependency of python3-requests,
  # but they switched to python3-charset-normalizer instead,
  # no need to maintain 2 packages with the same purpose
  - python3-chardet
  # tomllib is in the Python standard library (PEP 680), use that one instead
  - python3-toml
  - python3-tomli
  # python3-py is in maintenance mode upstream, pretty much dead
  # it used to be in RHEL as a dependency of pytest which bundled the necessary parts
  - python3-py

  - python3.9
  - python3.10
  - python3.11
  - python3.11-libs
