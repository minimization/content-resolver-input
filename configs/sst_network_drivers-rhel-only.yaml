      #requires:
      #- mvapich2  asamalik: I'm commenting mvapich2 out as it's a placeholder, and this
      #                      field is meant to be used to pull existing packages in.
      #                      Since mvapich2 is listed, it'll be on the list anyway,
      #                      so this won't change anything. Just stops the workload from failing.
