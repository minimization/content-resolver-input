  description: Unwanted packages implementing cryptography
  # Simo Sorce: The packages are unwanted either because they are
  # bad cryptography implementation, unmaintained, or simply not
  # certifiable or redundant (same functionality already present
  # in multiple crypto packages already and we do not want to add
  # more).
  # More info in the original PR 15
