  name: Bootstrap environment for Java packages
  description: |
    Buildroot-only packages required to build Java packages in
    bootstrap mode.  Not pulled-in via dependency resolution because
    in normal conditions bootstrapping is disabled, so RPM
    dependencies on bootstrap packages are absent.
