  description: Next version of Python interpreter
  maintainer: rhel-sst-pt-python-ruby-nodejs
  packages:
    # Each 3.Y version of Python is built as its own source package, with 
    # the default version providing python3- rather than python3.Y- 
    # packages. When the default version is changed, both the previous and 
    # new version are rebuilt in a side tag, along with Python-dependent 
    # packages to use the new version. When that side-tag is merged, the 
    # previous version build gets triggered in ELN, but CR doesn't know to 
    # trigger a build of the new default version, and composes break as a 
    # result.
    #
    # Generally, this resolves to python3 already listed in the python 
    # workload, but this should assure that the next future package gets 
    # rebuilt immediately. Once the next new (alpha) version is available 
    # in Fedora, this should then be updated to that new version of Python. 
    # At that point, CR will continue to handle both the current/previous 
    # and future/new versions normally until all dependents have been 
    # updated for the new python version, at which point the previous 
    # package will drop out of ELN.
    - python3.14
  labels:
    # Before becoming the default, the new version does not belong in ELN,
    # but may be added to CS as a non-default version (AppStream).
